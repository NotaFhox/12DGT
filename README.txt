* **HTML (`index.html`):** Contains the basic structure of the website, including placeholders for the navigation and dynamic content.  It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.
* **CSS (`style.css`):** Contains all the styling for the website, including the layout, colors, fonts, and animations.  It is linked in the HTML file.
* **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Contains all the client-side JavaScript code, including functions to load navigation, handle page content, and manage the booking form.  It is linked in the HTML file.
* **PHP (`get_navigation.php`):** A PHP script that retrieves the navigation data (in this case, a hardcoded array) and returns it as JSON.  This is fetched by the JavaScript code.
* **PHP (`get_page.php`):** A PHP script that retrieves the content for a specific page based on the `page` parameter in the URL.  It returns the content as JSON, which is then inserted into the HTML by the JavaScript code.
* **PHP (`process_booking.php`):** A PHP script that handles the submission of the booking form.  It retrieves the form data, validates it, and then simulates processing the booking (in a real application, it would save the data to a database and send an email).  It returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
